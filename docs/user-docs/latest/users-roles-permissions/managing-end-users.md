# Managing end-users accounts

[Content Manager > Users + mention Advanced Settings for sign-ups enablement]

End-users are the users who consume the content created and managed with a Strapi application. Unlike the administrators, they do not have access to the admin panel. End-users are managed with the Users & Permissions plugin (see List of plugins). The Users & Permissions configurations and options are however scattered at various places of the admin panel: end-users roles and permissions are managed in the Settings interface (see Configuring end-users roles), whereas end-users accounts are managed from the Content Manager.

The configurations of the end-users roles and permissions are available in the *Users & Permissions plugin* section of the Settings interface, accessible from *General > Settings* in the main navigation of the admin panel.
